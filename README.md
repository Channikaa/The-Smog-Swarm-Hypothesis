# The-Smog-Swarm-Hypothesis
The Smog &amp; Swarm Hypothesis, a part of Advanced Data Science Class Group Assignment 
- Objective
To investigate the temporal correlation between PM2.5 levels and Mosquito-Borne Disease
(MBD) incidence in Cambodia to validate if pollution suppresses or promotes vector activity.
- The Scientific Hypothesis

  - H0 (Null): PM2.5 levels have no statistically significant impact on mosquito-borne
disease rates.

  - H1 (Stress Hypothesis): High PM2.5 particulates block mosquito spiracles (breathing
pores) and olfactory sensors, leading to reduced biting activity and lower disease
transmission.

  - H2 (Urbanization Hypothesis): High PM2.5 is a proxy for dense urbanization and heat,
which correlates with higher mosquito breeding and dengue cases.
